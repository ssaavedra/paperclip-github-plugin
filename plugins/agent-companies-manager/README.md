# agent-companies-manager

Paperclip plugin package for importing Agent Companies from repositories that follow the Agent Companies specification and keeping them aligned with upstream sources.

## Specification-first workflow

Development for this plugin is driven by [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md). Implementation, tests, and documentation should be validated against the spec before a task is considered complete.

## Available scripts

- `pnpm test` — runs the package-level Node tests.
- `pnpm test:e2e` — installs the required Playwright Chromium binary if needed, boots an isolated Paperclip instance on free random ports from a generated local config, seeds a dummy company through the Paperclip API, installs this local plugin package, and verifies with Playwright that the Paperclip plugins settings page loads in headless mode.
- `pnpm verify:manual` — prepares the same disposable Paperclip instance on free random ports, opens the real plugin settings URL in your default browser automatically, and keeps the server running for manual inspection until you stop it with `Ctrl+C`.

## Installable plugin package contract

This package now includes the Paperclip plugin metadata and runtime artifacts expected by `paperclipai plugin install --local`:

- `package.json` declares `paperclipPlugin.manifest`, `paperclipPlugin.worker`, and `paperclipPlugin.ui`
- `dist/manifest.js` exports a valid Paperclip manifest with `apiVersion`, categories, capabilities, and entrypoints
- `dist/worker.js` and `dist/ui/index.js` provide the corresponding runtime artifacts

That packaging support exists so the local plugin can be installed into disposable Paperclip test instances during end-to-end verification.

## End-to-end test harness

The end-to-end smoke test lives in `scripts/e2e/run-paperclip-smoke.mjs` and is intended to be reusable by future sessions.

What it does:

1. Creates a disposable Paperclip home and data directory under the system temp folder.
2. Writes a schema-valid local Paperclip config directly, without running onboarding.
3. Starts a test-scoped Paperclip server.
4. Seeds a dummy company through the Paperclip API so the UI no longer redirects to `/onboarding`.
5. Verifies the seeded company exists through `paperclipai company list --json`.
6. Installs this plugin into the temporary Paperclip instance using `paperclipai plugin install --local`.
7. Uses Playwright in headless mode to open the Paperclip UI and verify the plugins settings page can be reached.

The harness writes the most recent detected plugins settings path to `tests/e2e/results/last-run.json` to make route discovery visible across sessions.

## Manual verification

Run this from the plugin directory:

```bash
pnpm verify:manual
```

The command opens the actual disposable instance URL in your default browser, prints the same URL to the terminal, keeps the Paperclip instance running, and leaves cleanup to `Ctrl+C`. This is useful when you want to inspect the seeded instance yourself after the plugin is installed.

## Current package layout

- `src/manifest.ts` - source manifest placeholder
- `src/worker.ts` - source worker stub with seed company data
- `src/ui/index.tsx` - source UI placeholder renderer
- `dist/manifest.js` - installable Paperclip manifest entrypoint
- `dist/worker.js` - installable worker artifact
- `dist/ui/index.js` - installable UI artifact
- `tests/plugin.spec.ts` - basic structure tests
- `scripts/e2e/run-paperclip-smoke.mjs` - reusable headless Paperclip + Playwright smoke test harness
- `scripts/e2e/manual-paperclip-verify.mjs` - disposable manual inspection harness that keeps Paperclip alive until interrupted

## Notes

This package is still scaffold-level on the product implementation side, but it now has enough Paperclip packaging and end-to-end infrastructure to exercise real local installation in a disposable instance instead of only running placeholder source tests.
