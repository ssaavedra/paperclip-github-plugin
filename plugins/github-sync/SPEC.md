# GitHub Sync plugin specification

GitHub Sync is a Paperclip plugin for registering one or more GitHub repositories and synchronizing their open issues into Paperclip projects.

## Repository registration

The plugin MUST provide a settings page inside Paperclip where an operator can configure:

- a GitHub token stored as a Paperclip secret reference
- one or more GitHub repository mappings
- the frequency for automatic scheduled sync runs
- a Paperclip project name per mapping where synchronized issues should be created

The settings page MUST allow saving mappings and triggering a manual sync.

## Secret handling

- The raw GitHub token MUST NOT be persisted in plugin state.
- Saving a token from the settings UI MUST create or reuse a company secret through the Paperclip host API.
- The plugin MUST persist only the resulting secret UUID in plugin instance config.
- The worker MUST resolve that secret UUID at runtime via `ctx.secrets.resolve(...)`.

## Synchronization behavior

The plugin MUST persist repository mappings and sync state in plugin state.
- The worker MUST expose at least one data endpoint for reading the current settings and sync status.
- The worker MUST expose action endpoints for saving mappings and triggering a manual sync.
- The plugin MUST declare a scheduled job that ticks every minute and only performs a scheduled sync when the saved frequency is due.
- The sync flow MUST fetch open GitHub issues from every configured repository.
- The sync flow MUST create one Paperclip issue per imported GitHub issue when the target mapping has a resolved Paperclip project identifier.
- Repeated sync runs MUST skip issues that were already imported for the same mapping.

## Project binding behavior

- Saving a mapping MUST create or reuse the target Paperclip project.
- Saving a mapping MUST bind the GitHub repository URL to the Paperclip project workspace.
- Once a project has been created and linked, its project name field SHOULD be treated as read-only in the settings UI.

## Host integration requirements

- The plugin MUST register successfully in Paperclip.
- The plugin MUST expose a dashboard widget contribution.
- The plugin MUST expose a settings page contribution.
- The dashboard widget MUST summarize the current GitHub sync readiness and link to setup.
- The settings page MUST render inside the real Paperclip host.
- The plugin MUST include end-to-end automation that boots a disposable Paperclip instance, installs the plugin, and verifies the settings page renders.
