# github-sync

Paperclip plugin for synchronizing GitHub issues into Paperclip.

## Current status

This package now includes:

- a valid Paperclip plugin manifest
- a dashboard widget UI mounted inside Paperclip for setup and sync readiness
- a worker that persists repository mappings and sync state in plugin state
- a token flow that stores the GitHub credential as a Paperclip company secret and persists only its secret reference in plugin config
- a settings page UI mounted inside Paperclip for configuring GitHub sync
- a configurable automatic sync cadence saved from the settings UI
- a scheduled sync job declaration that checks every minute and runs when the saved cadence is due
- a manual sync action from the settings page
- GitHub issue fetching through Octokit
- sync status reporting in the settings UI
- plugin-owned deduplication so repeated sync runs skip GitHub issues that were already imported
- reusable end-to-end automation that boots an isolated Paperclip instance, installs the plugin, and verifies the settings UI renders in the real host

## Available scripts

- `pnpm build` — bundles `src/manifest.ts`, `src/worker.ts`, and `src/ui/index.tsx` into `dist/`.
- `pnpm test` — runs the package-level Node tests.
- `pnpm test:e2e` — builds the plugin, installs Playwright Chromium if needed, boots an isolated Paperclip instance, installs this plugin, opens the real settings page, and verifies the settings UI renders.
- `pnpm verify:manual` — builds the plugin, boots the same disposable Paperclip instance, and opens the plugin settings page in your default browser for manual inspection.
- `pnpm typecheck` — runs TypeScript without emitting files.

## Current package layout

- `src/manifest.ts` - plugin manifest source, including dashboard/settings UI slots, the scheduled job declaration, and config schema
- `src/worker.ts` - worker logic for persisted mappings, sync state, configurable scheduled sync cadence, GitHub issue fetching, and deduplication
- `src/ui/index.tsx` - dashboard widget and settings page UI for token secret creation, mappings, configurable sync cadence, and sync status
- `dist/` - built plugin artifacts consumed by Paperclip
- `tests/plugin.spec.ts` - package-level tests
- `scripts/build.mjs` - package build script powered by esbuild
- `scripts/e2e/run-paperclip-smoke.mjs` - reusable headless Paperclip + Playwright end-to-end harness
- `scripts/e2e/manual-paperclip-verify.mjs` - disposable manual inspection harness

## Notes

The package now has a real build step so `dist/` stays aligned with `src/` before manual verification or plugin installation. The dashboard widget surfaces the current blocker or readiness state and links back to plugin setup. Saving a token validates it against the GitHub API, creates or reuses a company secret, and stores only the returned secret UUID in plugin config. Saving setup now persists both repository mappings and the selected automatic sync cadence. Scheduled job ticks happen every minute, and the worker skips runs until the saved cadence is actually due. Saving a mapping creates or reuses the target Paperclip project and binds the GitHub repository URL to the project workspace. Repeated sync runs keep a plugin-owned import registry so previously imported GitHub issues are skipped instead of being recreated.
