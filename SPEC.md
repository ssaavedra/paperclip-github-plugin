# GitHub Sync plugin specification

GitHub Sync is a Paperclip plugin for registering one or more GitHub repositories and synchronizing their open issues into Paperclip projects.

## Repository registration

The plugin MUST provide a settings page inside Paperclip where an operator can configure:

- a GitHub token stored as a Paperclip secret reference
- an optional external config file at `~/.paperclip/plugins/github-sync/config.json` for worker-only global values such as a raw `githubToken`
- Paperclip board access, which is optional on unauthenticated deployments and required when the Paperclip deployment reports `deploymentMode: "authenticated"`
- one or more GitHub repository mappings
- company-scoped advanced defaults for imported issues: default assignee, default Paperclip status, and ignored GitHub issue authors, where a saved username such as `renovate` also matches GitHub bot logins such as `renovate[bot]`
- the frequency for automatic scheduled sync runs
- a Paperclip project name per mapping where synchronized issues should be created, including existing Paperclip projects that are already bound to a GitHub repository workspace

The settings page MUST allow saving mappings and triggering a manual sync.
- When the settings page is opened with a Paperclip company context, it MUST only display and save repository mappings for that company, and saving one company’s mappings MUST preserve mappings that belong to other companies.
- When the settings page is opened with a Paperclip company context, it MUST only display and save advanced issue defaults for that company, and saving one company’s defaults MUST preserve defaults that belong to other companies.
- The settings page SHOULD clearly label company-scoped setup versus plugin-instance-wide setup when both are shown together.
- When a company context is present, the settings page SHOULD show the active company name prominently using a human-friendly label instead of a raw identifier.
- When a company already has Paperclip projects bound to GitHub repository workspaces, the settings page SHOULD surface those projects so an operator can enable sync without recreating the project.
- The plugin SHOULD also expose manual sync entry points from Paperclip toolbar surfaces when the SDK supports them.
- When a manual sync will outlive a quick action response, the worker MUST persist a `running` sync state immediately and complete the sync asynchronously.
- Once a sync is running, the settings page, dashboard widget, and toolbar sync entry points MUST provide a way to request cancellation, and the worker MUST stop cooperatively after the current repository or issue step finishes.
- The settings page, dashboard widget, and sync toolbar surfaces SHOULD detect authenticated deployments from `/api/health` and MUST require connected Paperclip board access before enabling sync for the affected company.

## Secret handling

- The raw GitHub token MUST NOT be persisted in plugin state.
- Saving a token from the settings UI MUST create or reuse a company secret through the Paperclip host API.
- The plugin MUST persist only the resulting secret UUID in plugin instance config.
- The worker MUST resolve that secret UUID at runtime via `ctx.secrets.resolve(...)`.
- If `~/.paperclip/plugins/github-sync/config.json` exists and contains a string `githubToken`, the worker MUST treat it as a worker-only fallback source for the GitHub token without persisting or returning that raw token.
- The raw Paperclip board API token MUST NOT be persisted in plugin state.
- Connecting Paperclip board access from the settings UI MUST create or reuse a company secret through the Paperclip host API and MUST persist only the resulting secret UUID, keyed by company in plugin state and mirrored into plugin instance config so the worker can resolve it.
- The worker MUST resolve the saved Paperclip board token secret at runtime via `ctx.secrets.resolve(...)` before making direct Paperclip REST calls for that company, and MUST treat plugin config as the worker-readable source of truth for those secret refs.

## Synchronization behavior

The plugin MUST persist repository mappings, company-scoped advanced issue defaults, and sync state in plugin state.
- The worker MUST expose at least one data endpoint for reading the current settings and sync status.
- The worker MUST expose action endpoints for saving mappings and triggering a manual sync.
- The worker SHOULD expose project-scoped pull request read models and actions for mapped repositories, including a lightweight queue read, a lightweight open-count read for sidebar badges, an on-demand detail read, and row-level actions for linking a Paperclip issue, merging, closing, and commenting.
- The worker SHOULD keep the default pull request queue read lightweight, use a lighter repo-wide metrics read for the summary cards, keep a separate cached full-summary path for filtered views, and invalidate those caches after pull request mutations.
- When resolving a Paperclip issue for a pull request, the worker SHOULD first match GitHub issues referenced in `closingIssuesReferences` to imported Paperclip issues and only fall back to pull-request-created issue links when no closing-issue match exists.
- The `sync.runNow` action SHOULD return the final sync result when it completes quickly, but MUST otherwise return promptly with the saved `running` state instead of waiting long enough to time out the host request.
- A manual sync requested from a company-scoped settings or dashboard view MUST only sync repository mappings for that company.
- The worker SHOULD support targeted manual sync requests for a specific mapped Paperclip project or imported Paperclip issue.
- The plugin MUST declare a scheduled job that ticks every minute and only performs a scheduled sync when the saved frequency is due.
- The plugin MUST expose agent tools for the GitHub issue and pull request workflow around synced work, including repository-item search, issue reads and updates, issue comment reads and writes, pull request creation and updates, pull request file and CI inspection, review-thread reads and replies, review-thread resolution changes, and pull request reviewer requests.
- Agent tools that post GitHub comments or review-thread replies MUST require the caller to identify the LLM used and MUST append a footer that discloses that a Paperclip AI agent created the message and which LLM was used.
- The sync flow MUST fetch open GitHub issues from every configured repository.
- The sync flow MUST ignore GitHub issues whose author username matches a configured ignored username for that mapping company.
- The sync flow MUST create one top-level Paperclip issue per imported GitHub issue when the target mapping has a resolved Paperclip project identifier.
- When the mapping company has a configured default assignee, the sync flow MUST assign newly created imported Paperclip issues to that Paperclip agent.
- Imported Paperclip issues MUST keep the original GitHub issue title without adding a `[GitHub]` prefix.
- Imported issue descriptions SHOULD contain the normalized GitHub body when present and MUST normalize the GitHub raw HTML constructs that Paperclip cannot render in multiline descriptions.
- GitHub repository, issue, PR, label, and sync metadata SHOULD move into a dedicated issue detail surface instead of being prepended into the issue description.
- Repeated sync runs MUST continue reconciling imported Paperclip issue descriptions against the latest GitHub issue body.
- Saving setup MUST persist the current Paperclip host origin so scheduled sync runs can call the local Paperclip label API later.
- The worker MUST treat the runtime `PAPERCLIP_API_URL` or plugin-configured Paperclip API origin as the trusted source for direct authenticated Paperclip REST calls, and MUST reject ad hoc action inputs that point at a different origin.
- When the worker is configured with a runtime `PAPERCLIP_API_URL`, that worker-accessible API origin MUST take precedence over the UI-saved host origin for local Paperclip REST calls.
- Before a manual or scheduled sync touches any mapping whose company is missing board access, the worker MUST probe `/api/health` on the resolved Paperclip API origin and fail fast with configuration guidance when that deployment reports `deploymentMode: "authenticated"`.
- When a company has connected Paperclip board access, the worker MUST attach `Authorization: Bearer <board-token>` to direct Paperclip REST issue and label calls for that company.
- When the Paperclip runtime exposes existing issue labels for the target company, the sync flow MUST map GitHub labels onto matching Paperclip labels by name and SHOULD prefer an exact color match when multiple Paperclip labels share the same name.
- When no matching Paperclip label exists and the local Paperclip label API is reachable, the sync flow MUST create the missing Paperclip label using the GitHub label color when available before attaching it to the imported issue.
- When a local Paperclip REST call returns an unexpected non-JSON success payload, such as an authenticated HTML sign-in page, the worker MUST treat that response as unavailable, fall back to SDK-based issue mutation when possible, and surface an actionable sync error that points operators to Paperclip board access or `PAPERCLIP_API_URL` when labels still cannot be reconciled.
- Repeated sync runs MUST skip recreating issues that were already imported for the same mapping.
- If the plugin-owned import registry is stale or missing, repeated sync runs MUST repair deduplication by reusing an existing imported Paperclip issue in the mapped project when durable GitHub link metadata or, for legacy issues, the description source link matches the GitHub issue URL.
- The worker SHOULD persist pull request to Paperclip issue links in a plugin-owned entity so project-scoped queue and detail surfaces can reuse durable links without reparsing issue descriptions.
- Repeated sync runs MUST continue reconciling imported Paperclip issue statuses against the latest GitHub state.
- When the local Paperclip host API is available, sync-driven Paperclip status transitions SHOULD go through the same issue-update path Paperclip UI uses so timeline activity is recorded for agents and humans.
- Repeated sync runs MUST continue reconciling imported Paperclip issue labels against the latest mapped GitHub labels, including removing labels that were removed on GitHub.
- An open GitHub issue without a linked PR MUST map to the configured default Paperclip status when it is first imported, and that default MUST be `backlog` when the company has not chosen another status.
- If an imported Paperclip issue is currently `backlog` and its linked GitHub issue is still open, the sync flow MUST preserve `backlog`; only a manual Paperclip transition may move it out of `backlog`.
- If a Paperclip issue that came from an open GitHub issue without a linked PR is later moved out of `backlog`, the sync flow SHOULD preserve that Paperclip status until another open-issue GitHub rule applies.
- An open GitHub issue with a linked PR that still has unfinished CI jobs MUST map to Paperclip `in_progress`.
- An open GitHub issue with a linked PR that has red CI jobs or unresolved review threads MUST map to Paperclip `todo`.
- An open GitHub issue with a linked PR that has green CI and all review threads resolved MUST map to Paperclip `in_review`.
- A closed GitHub issue completed as finished work MUST map to Paperclip `done`.
- A closed GitHub issue closed as not planned or duplicate MUST map to Paperclip `cancelled`.
- A new GitHub issue comment on an open imported issue MUST move the corresponding Paperclip issue back to `todo` only when at least one newly added comment since the last sync was written by the original GitHub issue author or by a repository maintainer/admin that the worker can verify through the GitHub API.
- A new GitHub issue comment from any other GitHub account MUST NOT move the corresponding Paperclip issue back to `todo`.
- If that Paperclip issue is currently `backlog`, trusted GitHub comments MUST still leave it in `backlog`.
- Whenever the sync flow changes a Paperclip issue status, it MUST add a Paperclip issue comment that explains the old status, the new status, and the GitHub condition that caused the transition.
- When the SDK supports comment annotations, the plugin SHOULD render the referenced GitHub issue and PR links as a comment annotation attached to those sync-created comments.

## Project binding behavior

- Saving a mapping MUST create or reuse the target Paperclip project.
- Saving a company-scoped mapping from the settings page MUST create or reuse the target Paperclip project in that same company.
- Saving a mapping for a Paperclip project that is already bound to the GitHub repository MUST reuse that existing project instead of creating a duplicate workspace binding.
- Saving a mapping MUST bind the GitHub repository URL to the Paperclip project workspace.
- Once a project has been created and linked, its project name field SHOULD be treated as read-only in the settings UI.

## Host integration requirements

- The plugin MUST register successfully in Paperclip.
- The plugin MUST expose a dashboard widget contribution.
- The plugin MUST expose a settings page contribution.
- The plugin SHOULD expose an issue detail contribution for GitHub metadata.
- The plugin SHOULD expose a project sidebar item that opens a project-scoped Pull Requests page for the mapped repository and can show the current open pull request count for mapped projects through a lightweight count read instead of the heavier summary-card metrics path.
- The project Pull Requests page SHOULD render live open pull request data for the mapped repository, including checks, review summary, unresolved review-thread state, non-review comment counts, age, last-updated timestamps, Paperclip issue linkage, and quick actions.
- The project Pull Requests page SHOULD surface total, mergeable, reviewable, and failing summary counts and let operators filter the table from those cards.
- The project Pull Requests page SHOULD keep KPI-triggered filtered views fast by reusing cached repo-wide filter indexes and fetching only the visible filtered rows instead of rebuilding every row summary on each click.
- The project Pull Requests page SHOULD favor repository-scoped caches for totals, KPI aggregates, and per-pull-request review or CI insights, and SHOULD expose an explicit refresh path that invalidates those caches on demand.
- The project Pull Requests page SHOULD paginate the queue in batches of 10 rows.
- The project Pull Requests page SHOULD deep-link row icons to the relevant GitHub resource where possible.
- The project Pull Requests page SHOULD render markdown and only sanitized, allowlisted inline HTML in pull request descriptions and comments instead of showing raw author text.
- The pull request markdown renderer MUST strip event-handler attributes, inline styles, executable or embedded elements, and unsafe URL schemes, and SHOULD limit inline HTML support to non-executable formatting and link elements such as `a`, `code`, `em`, `strong`, `b`, `i`, `br`, `span`, `sub`, and `sup`; allowed attributes SHOULD stay limited to safe link metadata such as `href`, `title`, and `target` on `a`, plus `class` on `span` where markdown-compatible formatting needs it.
- The project Pull Requests page SHOULD include a compact inline comment composer in the bottom detail pane.
- The project Pull Requests page SHOULD support modal quick actions for commenting, reviewing, re-running CI, and confirming close actions in addition to merge when the pull request state allows them.
- When GitHub rejects a pull request comment or review action, the worker and UI SHOULD preserve actionable permission or validation guidance instead of collapsing it to a generic error.
- When a pull request is linked to a Paperclip issue, the project Pull Requests page SHOULD open that issue in a plugin-provided right drawer so operators can stay on the queue page, while still allowing explicit navigation away when desired.
- When a pull request is not yet linked to a Paperclip issue, the project Pull Requests page SHOULD offer an inline create-issue action and wait for the returned Paperclip identifier before rendering the issue link or opening its drawer.
- The plugin SHOULD expose manual sync buttons in the global toolbar and on mapped project/issue surfaces when the host renders those slot types.
- The dashboard widget MUST summarize the current GitHub sync readiness and link to setup.
- When the latest sync run records issue-level failures, the settings page SHOULD expose a saved failure log with per-failure repository, issue, phase, raw error, and suggested next-step details, and compact surfaces SHOULD still surface at least the latest saved failure snapshot.
- The settings page MUST render inside the real Paperclip host.
- The plugin MUST include end-to-end automation that boots a disposable Paperclip instance, installs the plugin, and verifies the settings page renders.

## Packaging and release requirements

- The build pipeline MUST bundle the manifest and worker for Node execution and bundle the hosted UI separately for browser execution.
- Local development SHOULD provide a watch-mode build and a local UI dev server for hosted-UI iteration.
- The build pipeline MUST stamp the plugin manifest version from build-time package metadata rather than keeping a separately hardcoded manifest version.
- The release workflow MUST derive the published version from the GitHub release tag and stamp that version into publishable package metadata before build and publish.
- The release workflow MUST run on a Node.js version that already satisfies npm trusted publishing requirements instead of relying on an in-job npm self-upgrade step.
